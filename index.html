          Thanks for using tachikoma.io for a long time. Since we launched
          tachikoma.io in September 2014, a lot of users have improved their
          applications. It was a good challenge for you and us.

          Unfortunately, our resources are limited. We decide that we will close
          our service on October 20, 2020. Sorry for this inconvenience.
